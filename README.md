# Project
  The Airbus Ship Detection Challenge on Kaggle is a computer vision competition that tasks participants with developing models to automatically identify and localize ships in satellite imagery. The goal is to create an algorithm that can accurately draw bounding boxes or pixel-level masks around ships, thereby aiding maritime surveillance and efficiency. This project involves significant work in image segmentation and object detection using machine learning techniques.

## Key Aspects of the Project
  **Goal:** To automatically detect and localize ships in satellite images.

  **Data:** A large dataset of high-resolution satellite images provided by Airbus Defence and Space.

  **Task:** This is primarily an image segmentation challenge, where models must output masks that delineate the exact shape and location of each ship.

  **Application:** The resulting models have practical applications in maritime security, tracking, and logistics.
